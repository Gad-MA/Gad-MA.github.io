This repository contains the proposal, code, and documentation for my participation in the Google Summer of Code 2022 challenge. The project focuses on developing a versatile image processing methodology to auto-detect coverage bounding boxes on brain MRI images based on stated anatomic landmarks and you can find it at (GSOC Proposal)[Proposal-YasienEssam].
