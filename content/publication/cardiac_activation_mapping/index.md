abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart arrhythmia, affecting millions worldwide. Diagnosis and treatment of AF often involves creating electro-anatomic activation maps, which represent the timing of tissue activation across the heartâ€™s atria. Current mapping methods use interpolation techniques like linear or Gaussian process regression based on sparse electrode data collected within the atria. However, these techniques suffer from noise from electrode positioning and lack of prior physical knowledge of cardiac wave propagation, leading to suboptimal diagnostic accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) for cardiac activation mapping that incorporates the underlying wave propagation dynamics of cardiac electrical activity. Benchmarking against traditional interpolation and Gaussian process regression, the PINN model demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy, paving the way for improved procedural efficiency and patient outcomes in atrial fibrillation diagnostics.
